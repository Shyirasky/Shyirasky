- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Shyirasky
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in games development and gaming in general.
- ðŸŽ® About Me   
      After completing my HND in Computer Science, I decided to pivot toward something Iâ€™ve always been passionate about â€” Game Design. Iâ€™m now pursuing a degree in this field, expanding my skills in Unity and C# (which Iâ€™ve already been using for over two years).
      My current studies go beyond coding, covering key areas such as game QA, 2D animation, and 3D reconstruction â€” bringing real-world objects into digital environments to enhance gameplay and design realism.
      Alongside my coursework, Iâ€™m developing my own independent Unity project, a small game that allows me to apply and refine everything Iâ€™ve learned.
